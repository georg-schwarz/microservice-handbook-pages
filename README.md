# A Handbook of Microservice Integration Techniques

This repository hosts the integration techniques I found during my research at the [Professorship of Open Source Software](https://oss.cs.fau.de/) at [Friedrich-Alexander University Erlangen-NÃ¼rnberg](https://fau.de).
These results are part of my dissertation called "A theory of microservice integration".
